## What is Markup?

"Markup language" refers to any computationally processable language that focus on human-readable text structures, as opposed to data or instructions.

* JavaScript, Python and other "programming languages" are instruction languages

  * They express sequences of instructions

  * They express data in structures

* HTML, reStructuredText and Markdown are markup languages
